# Email Processing Skill

Email is other people's priorities arriving in your space. Process it quickly into your system, then get back to meaningful work.

## Core Principles

1. **Process, don't check** — Touch each email once, make a decision, move it out
2. **Batch into blocks** — 2-3 scheduled times daily, email closed otherwise
3. **Inbox is not a task list** — Extract actions to your task system
4. **2-minute rule** — If it takes less, do it now

## The Decision Tree

```
Is it actionable?
├── NO →
│   ├── Delete (no value)
│   ├── Archive (reference)
│   └── Someday/Maybe (future idea)
└── YES → What's the next action?
    ├── < 2 min → Do it NOW
    └── > 2 min →
        ├── Delegate → Forward + Waiting For list
        └── Keep → Extract to task system, archive email
```

## Email Block Routine (15-30 min)

1. Scan for truly urgent items (rare)
2. Process top-to-bottom, one decision per email
3. Target inbox zero
4. Close email until next block

## Suggested Schedule

| Block | Time | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Morning | 9:00am | Process overnight items |
| Midday | 1:00pm | Catch urgent replies |
| End of day | 4:30pm | Clear before shutdown |

Protect morning focus hours — don't start the day in email.

## Folder Structure (Keep Simple)

- **Inbox** — Temporary, process to zero
- **@Action** — Items needing >2 min work (optional, prefer external task system)
- **@Waiting** — Sent items awaiting reply
- **Archive** — Everything else worth keeping

## Quick Response Templates

**Acknowledge + Timeline**: "Got it—I'll have this by [date]."

**Delegate**: "Looping in [Name] who can help with this."

**Decline**: "Can't take this on right now. Have you tried [alternative]?"

**Defer**: "On my radar. I'll follow up by [date]."

## Rules

- Never use inbox as a reminder system
- Never leave emails "unread" as markers
- Never process email during deep work
- Set expectations: you don't reply instantly

## Extracting Actions

When an email requires real work:

1. Identify the concrete next action
2. Write it in your task system with context
3. Archive the email (or link to it)
4. The email leaves your inbox; the action lives in your system
